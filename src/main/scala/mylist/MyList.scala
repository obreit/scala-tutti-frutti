    2 things happening here
    1:
      Preface:
      Any method that is defined on a class can be called with omitting the dot '.'
      class Baby() {
        def sayHelloTo(name: String): String = s"$name!"
        def sayHelloToAll(n1: String, n2: String): String = s"$n1 and $n2!"
      }
      val baby = new Baby()
      baby.sayHelloTo("Mom") == baby sayHelloTo("Mom")
      baby.sayHelloToAll("Mom", "Dad") == baby sayHelloToAll("Mom", "Dad")

      Additionally, if the method only takes one parameter you can omit the parentheses '()'.
      baby.sayHelloTo("Mom") == baby sayHelloTo "Mary"
      baby sayHelloToAll "Mom", "Dad" // doesn't compile for methods taking more than 1 parameter

      Usually, this syntax is discouraged, except for operators!
      Take for example 1 + 2. '+' is not a special keyword, it's just a regular method on the Int class that takes 1 argument.
      So the rules that we discussed above apply here. (It wouldn't be nice to always have to write
      1.+(2) 1.-(2) 1./(2) 1.*(2) 1.==(2))

      After you write the nice code, the compiler rewrites 1 + 2 to 1.+(2)


      Long story short, we define the 'prepend' operation as '+:'. The scala compiler has a rule that
      methods ending with ':' associate to the right. This allows us to use the prepend operation like this

      1 +: MyList(2,3) == MyList(2,3).+:(1) == MyList(1,2,3)

      One question that came up was:
      Why not just use the case class, which is also called '+:' (with package prefix 'mylist.+:'), as an operator like

      1 mylist.+: MyList(2,3)

      The reason is that the syntax that allows you to write

      1 + 2 or 1 +: MyList(2,3)

      is only defined for methods on classes. So you can't just define a method (or function or case class)
      and use it in infix notation.

      def add(i: Int, j: Int): Int = i + j
      1 add 2 // the compiler rewrites this to 1.add(2) which doesn't work
              // because 'add' is not a method defined on Int

      1 mylist.+: MyList(2,3) // the compiler rewrites this to MyList(2,3).mylist.+:(2,3) which leads to a complete breakdown
                              // with the message 'error: ';' expected but '.' found'. But if you change the case class name to
                              // ++++:, then the compiler rewrites 1 ++++: MyList(2,3) to MyList(2,3).++++:(1) and you
                              // get the expected error that ++++: is not a method defined on MyList

      Some more examples

      1 +: MyList(2,3) // works because '+:' is a method defined on MyList and ends with ':',
                       // so the compiler rewrites this to MyList(2,3).+:(1).

      MyList(2,3) +: 1 // doesn't work because the method ends with ':' so the compiler tries to rewrite
                       // it to 1.+:(MyList(1,2,3)) but '+:' is not a method on the Int class

      MyList(2,3).+:(1) // works because you are calling '+:' on an instance of MyList directly without the special syntax
                        // as you would do with any other method for that class

    2:
      Ideally the signature should look like 'def +:(elem: T): MyList[T]', so why do we make it complicated?
      See what happens if you use the "normal" signature 'def +:(elem: T): MyList[T]'.

      The 'U >: T' trick is due to variance. I don't have a very intuitive way to explain this, so I can only refer
      to the video linked above which explains it very nicely.
      It boils down to the fact that function parameters are contravariant (the video explains it!).
      E.g. the function taking 3 parameters is defined as 'Function3[-T1, -T2, -T3, +R]'.
      The function taking 1 parameter is defined as 'Function1[-T, +R]', and equivalently for all other functions.
      --> This means
      function input types are CONTRAvariant
      function return types are COvariant

      We define our data type as MyList[+T], so with a COvariant type T. So we can't use it as an input type
      in 'def +:(elem: T): MyList[T]', because we established that input types are CONTRAvariant. To overcome this,
      we create this CONTRAvariant fix 'U >: T'. Since 'T >: T', the usage of such a function stays the same luckily.

      (remember contravariant means:
       if you have types A,B and A >: B (A is a supertype of B) then for a container
       defined as Container[-T] it holds that Container[A] >: Container[B] (i.e. container of A is a supertype of a container of B))
